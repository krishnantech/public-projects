Generate a program to analyze financial statements to get total expenses of a trip, including transportation, hotels/resorts, flights, etc. Here are the requirements:

I'd like to get this analysis with a local AI such as Ollama since it may involve sensitive information. Therefore use Ollama APIs, assume a local model is already available.

Inputs to the program are:
a) start and date of the actual trip, location of the trip, accommodation (hotel, resort, cruise, etc.).
b) multiple csv files representing various financial statements like bank statements and credit card statements.

Outputs expected from the program:
a) List transactions grouped by broad category (accommodation, transport - uber/taxi/air travel, meals, tours, groceries at the location, etc.)
b) Sum total expenditure of each category
c) Sum total expenditure across all categories, i.e. sum total expenditure of the trip

The financial statements may be broader than just the date range of the trip, even by multiple months, to make sure that booking fees that are done in advance (resorts/hotels/flights/etc.) are not missed out. So the program has to be smart about it and not just examine dates of the trip, but upto a few months before for all advance bookings.
